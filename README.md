## Hi there 👋

I'm Ariav, a sophomore at UW-Madison double majoring in Computer and Data Science (B.S).

When I see a problem, I use code to build the solution.

On the topic of that philosophy, I'm currently working on a project called Capital City Food Carts. Check out the [repository](https://github.com/ariavhayempour/Capital_City_Food_Carts) and the [live wesbite](https://www.capitalcityfoodcarts.com)! 

P.S: If you spot any project bugs, send me a message :)
